### Explain how to create a repo on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.

Creating a repository is done through GitHub. When you log in to your account, you can access a small "plus" icon near your username in the upper right corner. Click on that plus sign and selected create a new repository. From there you'll be able to name the repository and set it up. 

Once the repository is created, you can clone it to your computer using the link GitHub provides on the right side of the page. You copy that link and then use the command 'git clone [COPIED LINK]' in your terminal. 

### Explain what open source means.

Open source software features publicly-available source code that anyone can view. As a result, anyone can also modify open source software and change it as they'd like. 

### What do you think about Open Source?

I think open source software is an amazing thing, and it allows everyone to benefit from technologies that would otherwise be isolated within a single person's or company's knowledge. The ability to have everyone who is willing and capable work on a project together is truly incredible. It doesn't make me nervous, but hte idea of everything being open source definitely feels utopian. 

### Assess the importance of using licenses.

Licenses are critical because an incredibly permissive open source license may not be the best option for every software project. While a license that allows everyone to do anything they want wit the code works in some situations, people working on certain projects may want to have protection for patents or requirements that contributions be open sourced baked into their software license. 

### What concepts were solidified in the challenge?

I struggled a lot with the previous challenge, but the workflow surrounding adding pushing and committing finally clicked with me during this challenge. I was able to complete the git-related tasks from memory and I am feeling more confident in the terminal than ever before. I didn't really struggle with this challenge, but that's mainly because I spent so much time repeating the previous exercise.
