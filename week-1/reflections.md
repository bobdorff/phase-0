# 1.1 Think About Time Reflection

During 1.1 I learned the most about meditation and the idea of small habits or changes dictating larger shifts in behavior. I was particularly interested in the idea of meditation's ability to increase empathy and self awareness even when you are not meditating. The idea that meditation has been linked to enhanced memory was also very appealing. I have used the Pomodoro Technique in my work life for around a year, so I am familiar with “time boxing,” or working intensely for a set period of time and then taking a short break.

I find that the Pomodoro Technique is largely successful for me, and this technique makes it remarkably easy to get a lot of work done during the day. In my current work environment, I am not particularly challenged by my daily tasks. That makes it difficult to achieve a state of “flow,” because boredom overwhelms the engagement created by learning new things. While the Pomodoros help me speed through this less-engaging work, it’s difficult to force myself to work harder than required for a job I am not particularly interested in. That means I have large periods of the work day that go underutilized. Following one of these aimless periods, I’ll click on the Pomodoro timer and swiftly wrap up everything I need to do. Ideally, I’d have increased focus to utilize all this time productively.

Moving forward in Phase 0 and beyond, I will continue to employ the Pomodoro Technique during daily tasks and will start a meditation practice in hopes of improving my overall focus. In keeping with the concept of “small habits”, I am going to begin meditating for just 5 minutes a day after I eat breakfast. Ideally, this practice will expand as I develop my mediation abilities.

# 1.2 The Command Line Reflection

The shell is a text-based way to work within the Unix operating system. Bash is a language that users can use to interact with the shell. The most challenging part of this lesson was understanding how 'pushd' and 'popd' interacted and how they could be useful while navigating the shell. Once I understood, however, they became very helpful. I was able to successfully use all the commands, and I find 'ls' to be the most helpful, particularly in combination with 'cd' and '../'. While exciting things can be done with more advanced commands, these provide all the tools needed to build a mental model of the directory hierarchy and let you know where you are in the file structure. 

pwd - print working directory

ls - list directory contents

mv - move or rename a directory

cd - change directory 

../ - move back one level within the directory hierarchy

touch - create a new file

mkdir - create a new directory

less - page through a file

rmdir - delete a directory

rm - delete a file

help - I have a Mac, so I used “man” instead, but this command lets you look up the manual entry for a certain command. 

# 1.4 Forking and Cloning Reflection

To create a new repository, you view your profile on GitHub and hit the plus button next to your name. This spawns a new repository to work in. If you wanted to fork that repository, you would view that repository and click the “fork” button. This generates a new fork of the repository for you, but to work in it, you’ll want to clone the repository on your local machine. To do that, you’ll go into the terminal, cd to the folder you want to work in and type “git clone” followed by the link provided on the GitHub page for your fork of the repository. 

You would want to fork a repository rather than create a new repo to get an identical copy of work that has already been completed. A new fork means that your work doesn’t affect the main version of a project. This also allows you to work on a project at the same time as other people without interfering with or overwriting their work. 

The git and GitHub setup process was very smooth for me, and I felt more comfortable using the command line than in the past. At the same time, I was very conscious of the need to type things precisely. Any confusion I had along the way was directly linked to my making a simple typo. It was a good reminder to slow down and ensure I’m typing the right things.
