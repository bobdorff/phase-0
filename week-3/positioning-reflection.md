_How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position code elements?_
	The devtools built into chrome let you inspect the code that impacts the behavior of specic elements on the page, and make it simpleto edit that code in real time. This allows you to see how changes to the code affect the way things appear on the page. If you are considering tweaking elements of a page, you can test your changes in the Dev Tools first. 

_How can you resize elements in the DOM using CSS?_
	Resizing is simple in the DOM because you are able to edit the code associated with a page's style sheet. The changes that you make will overwrite that code in the original page, so you can see the results of your changes immediately. To change the size of an element, you'd simply alter the width and height. 

_What are the differences between absolute, fixed and static positioning?_
	Aboslutely positioned elements are not included in the normal flow of the document. This means they don't necessarily respond to the position or characteristics of other elements on the page. That allows you to place absolutely positioned elements on top of other elements or beneath others. 
	Fixed positioning works similarly to absolute positioning, in that it is relative to the browser window rather than other page elements. Unlike absolute elements, a fixed positioned element will not move when the page scrolls. 
	Static positioning is the default type of positioning for elements. These elements adhere to the normal page flow and box model that is inherent to CSS. They respond to other boxes and attributes on the page. 

_What are the differences between margin, border and padding?_
	Margin refers to the space outside an element's borders. It essentially creates blank space in the area surrounding an element. Padding refers to empty space within an element's border and can be used to expand the space around the content an element contains. The border itself is the line in between the padding and the margin.

_What was your impression of this challenge?_
	This was a difficult challenge overall, and it took me and my pair a lot of work. I think I had a poor understanding of positioning prior to the challenge, but working through this really solidified many of the important concepts. At the same time, this was overwhelming because I can tell there is a lot more to learn!
