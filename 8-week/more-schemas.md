What is a one-to-one database?
	A one to one database features two tables that have an identical number of rows because each row in one table has an equavlent space on the other table, though that field may not be filled in. 
When would you use a one-to-one database? (Think generally, not in terms of the example you created).
	You would create this type of relationship when you knew that every item in one table would either have a single corresponding value or would not. This allows you to find the items associated with the values in the second table by referring back from the second table. 
What is a many-to-many database?
	 In a many to many database individual elements in each table can reference several different elements in the other table. For instance, you might have a list of movies and a list of directors. Each movie will have at least one director, but two directors could have worked on the same movie and one director may have directed several moivies. 
When would you use a many-to-many database? (Think generally, not in terms of the example you created).
	You would use this structure when you knew that items in one table would need to be referenced by multiple items on another table and vice versa. 
What is confusing about database schemas? What makes sense?
	It makes sense in an abstract way to me, but I am still trying to identify situations when both of these schema will be useful. I'm sure that as we get more direct experience with data structures, I'll be able to identify situations where each is applicable.
