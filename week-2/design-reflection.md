_What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?_

-Information Gathering (Figuring out what you want the website to do)
-Planning (Mapping out how the site will meet those goals)
-Design (Developing the actual visual design for the site, including layout)
-Development (Creating code to realize your design)
-Testing and Delivery (Making sure that code works)
-Maintenance (Updating the site so it works in the future)

_What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?_

The goal of this website is to serve as a repository for professional information about me. I want people who visit the site to have a firm handle on who I am as a hire and what my professional experience has entailed. All of those elements will be secondary to a blog about professional topics, however. I think the blog should be the first thing people see when they show up on this site. From there, I want it to be easy to learn more about me, contact me or discover my projects. 


_What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?_

I think the target audience for this site is people who are interested in me in a professional capacity. As such, I want to make it very easy to learn about what I've done for work in the past. Putting the blog front and center is part of that effort. I've written professionally for the past year, and I think it's one of my strengths. Might as well put it up front. 

_What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors._

Ideally, someone who shows up on the site will read an article or two. I think that serves as a good introduction to me as a person. Ideally, they'll move from there to my about page where they can learn more about the person behind what they just read and find how to contact me. 

_What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?_

Good design requires planning and observation. It isn't necessarily based on how something looks visually, it's also related to how something functions when a user interacts with it. The prettiest page in the world is useless if the intended user can't find the information they need quickly and painlessly. As a result, good designers observe how people solve problems in every facet of life to solve problems related to design. 

_What is user experience design and why is it valuable?_

User experience design involves planning and creating the parts of a software product that people will interact with. Good UX is highly subjective, but when something is designed well, it eliminates the friction between a user and the information they need to access. 

_Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?_

No part of this challenge was particularly tedious to me. Honestly, the most boring and mindless part was sending the photo of my sitemap from my phone to my Mac!

Oh, and here's my sitemap: ![Sitemap](phase-0/week-2/imgs/site-map.jpg)
