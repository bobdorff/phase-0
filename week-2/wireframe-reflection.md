_What is a wireframe?_
It's a visual representation of how a site will be laid out. It does not necessarily feature all of the details that will be present when a site is completed, instead it is a two-dimensional blueprint that provides a rouch idea of where all the site's elements will end up.

_What are the benefits of wireframing?_
It lets you identify problems before they develop into something serious and helps you work through different design ideas in an area where it's safe to make mistakes. If you're working with clients, this allows you to get their approval before you start doing work that's more time consuming.

_Did you enjoy wireframing your site?_
Yep!
_Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?_
I revised it a bit, and I'm honestly not sure if what I came up with will be feasible given the tools in phase-0. I'm confident in the site's basic look, though. 

_What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?_
I was curious about the different wireframing tools listed in the articles, so I researched each of those. I was also very interested to see what wireframes developed by other people looked like, so I spent time looking at them on Tumblr.

_Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?_
I enjoyed drawing the wireframes. I am frustrated by not knowing exactly what I'm capable of creating. That's not tedium, exactly, but it was definitely the most negative part of this challenge for me. It's good, though, because it gets me fired up about creating.
