<!--
	1. What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
		It felt good! I'm actually surprised by how simple HTML is overall. That's not meant to sound cocky, but it's sort of crazy that the web's skeleton is so easy to wrap your brain around.

	2. How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
	 Relatively easy. It's pretty simple to find information about these formatting tools on the web.
    3. How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
      I think we did well. The only semantic element I used was a <strong> tag for the head.
	4. What seems good and bad about HTML?
		HTML is simple, which is good because it makes it easy to learn how to get a simplistic website up and running quickly. Unfortunately, HTML is simple, which means the sites you create will be relatively similar and have limited options for customization. I sense that much of what makes pages look signifcantly different will come in once we get to CSS.
	5. What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
		For me the real key is remembering to close all my tags. I have to double check this. Everything else has come pretty easily. I've considered making flashcards as we add more tags though. That might help drill some of the less-used ones into my head.
