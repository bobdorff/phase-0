// Data Structures: Objects and Arrays

// REFLECTION TYPE STUFF
// Did you learn anything new about JavaScript or programming in general?
// 	I didn't learn anything new, exactly, but it was a good review of what we're really doing when we program. So often it's easy to get wrapped up in the language and the syntax that you forget you're giving a computer a set of very simplistic instructions that add up to something more. 
// Are there any concepts you feel uncomfortable with?
// 	Not yet, though I'm sure that I'll have difficulty with some elements later!
