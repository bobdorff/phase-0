		If you're new to the world of web development, cascading style sheets, or "CSS" will be one of the most confounding things you have every encountered. HTML, which is the language used to create the skeleton of every website you visit, is relatively easy to understand. Each piece of content on a website, be it a link, article or photo, is assigned an HTML "tag". These tags tell a user's web browser how to render different parts of a web page. For instance, whenever a browser sees a tag featuring the letter "p," it knows that the site's author wants the information associated with that tag to display as a new paragraph.

		For modern websites that feature expansive and beautiful layouts, simple HTML tags don't provide enough informaiton. They can tell a browser how to display some information, but they aren't great at telling the browser where that information should be on the page and how individual elements should respond to a user's inputs. That's where CSS comes in. A programmer can assign traits to different HTML tags using CSS, and that makes it possible to create very complex layouts. For example, a programmer could use CSS to make every piece of content associated with a "p" tag on a webpage green.

		Programmers can achieve some amazing stuff by assigning CSS characteristics to specific HTML tags, but sometimes a programmer will want to do something to several different types of HTML tags, or a group of HTML tags that only apply to a specific part of a page. That's where classes and IDs come in.

		<h3>Class is in session</h3>
	<p>
		With a class or ID, a programmer can pull out specific items and assign them traits, regardless of what their HTML tags are. Classes are used to assign a group of CSS traits to multiple items, while IDs are used to give a single piece of a website new characteristics. As an example, if a programmer wanted links about a certain topic to behave differently than other links on a page, they could create a class called "topiclink". They could then assign special traits to that class. Whenever they assigned a piece of content to the "topiclink" class, it would get the same traits as all the other pieces of content with that class designation. 
	</p>
	<p>
		IDs are more specific. When someone wants one part of a site to have different formatting than other pieces, they can give that single piece of a content a unique ID name. Then, they can use CSS to assign that ID characteristics that will not be replicated elsewhere on the site. 
	</p>
	<p>
		If you're ever confused about when to use classes or IDs, you can think of it this way: In school, everyone in a class learns the same material. That's like a CSS class, because CSS traits assigned to a class affect all the members equally. An ID is more personal. You have an ID card that identifies you, and you're just one person. IDs in CSS are similarly specific and singular.
